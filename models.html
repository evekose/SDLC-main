    <button class="accordion">Waterfall Model</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Waterfall Model is a sequential model that divides software development into pre-defined phases. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin with no overlap between the phases. Each phase is designed for performing specific activity during the SDLC phase. It was introduced in 1970 by Winston Royce.</p>
        <p>Waterfall Methodology can be used when:
        
            -Requirements are not changing frequently
            -Application is not complicated and big
            -Project is short
            -Requirement is clear
            -Environment is stable
            -Technology and tools used are not dynamic and is stable
            -Resources are available and trained</p>

    <button class="accordion">Iterative Model</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Iterative and incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for development.</p>
        <p>The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system. Learning comes from both the development and use of the system, where possible key steps in the process start with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhance the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added.</p>
        <p>Many examples of early usage are provided in Craig Larman and Victor Basili's article "Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History", with one of the earliest being NASA's 1960s Project Mercury.</p>
        <p>When to use Iterative models?
            Requirements of the system are clearly understood
            When demand for an early release of a product arises
            When software engineering team are not very well skilled or trained
            When high-risk features and goals are involved
            Such methodology is more in use for web application and product based companies</p>

    <button class="accordion">Prototyping Model</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The prototyping model is a systems development method in which a prototype is built, tested and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable outcome is achieved from which the complete system or product can be developed. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This model works best in scenarios where not all of the project requirements are known in detail ahead of time. It is an iterative, trial-and-error process that takes place between the developers and the users.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Spiral Model</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Spiral Model is a risk-driven software development process model. It is a combination of waterfall model and iterative model. Spiral Model helps to adopt software development elements of multiple process models for the software project based on unique risk patterns ensuring efficient development process. The spiral model in software engineering was first mentioned by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper.</p>
      <p>When to use Spiral Model?
        A Spiral model in software engineering is used when project is large
        When releases are required to be frequent, spiral methodology is used
        When creation of a prototype is applicable
        When risk and costs evaluation is important
        Spiral methodology is useful for medium to high-risk projects
        When requirements are unclear and complex, Spiral model in SDLC is useful
        When changes may require at any time
        When long term project commitment is not feasible due to changes in economic priorities</p>
